"""
Re use the code from the previous assignment but modify it to fit these new instructions. We want the entire program to loop on repeat until the user stops it so dont get rid of that.
We want the user to be able to select one of the options to enter hours into instead of asking for all 4, one at a time.
Modify the program to display an at the moment of number of hours entered by the user.
